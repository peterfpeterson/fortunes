Heilmeier's Catechism
- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
- What are the risks and the payoffs?
- How much will it cost? How long will it take?
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

by George H. Heilmeier, President and CEO of Bellcore

I. Thou shalt never say ‘systematic error’ when thou meanest ‘systematic
effect’ or ‘sys-tematic mistake’.

II. Thou shalt not add uncertainties on uncertainties in quadrature. If they are
larger than chickenfeed thou shalt generate more Monte Carlo until they shrink
to become so.

III. Thou shalt know at all times whether what thou performestis a check for a
mistake or an evaluation of an uncertainty.

IV. Thou shalt not incorporate successful check results into thy total
systematic error and make thereby a shield behind which to hide thy
dodgy result.

  - R Barlow in Systematic Errors: Facts and Fictions
  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0207026

V. Thou shalt not incorporate failed check results unless thou art truly at
thy wits’ end.

  - R Barlow in Systematic Errors: Facts and Fictions
  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0207026
%
VI. Thou shalt say what thou doest, and thou shalt be able to justify it out of
thine own mouth; not the mouth of thy supervisor, nor thy colleague who did the
analysis last time, nor thy local statistics guru, nor thy mate down the pub.
