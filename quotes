There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the
sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern
type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‘I don’t see the use of this;
let us clear it away.’ To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do
well to answer: ‘If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you
clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me
that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
 - G.K. Chesterton's Fence
