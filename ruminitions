If I were a serial killer, I'd kill my victims with tools I borrowed

of those neighbors who kept to himself.     - Andy Ihnatko

I'd like to work as an ice cream truck driver.  Not only would I get
to eat a tasty treat any time I wanted, but I'm pretty sure I'd

One of the saddest days of my life was the day we put my Aunt Nettie
in a rest home. But if it weren't for sad times like that, I couldn't
